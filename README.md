The app fetches data from open movie database and:

- Presents the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- The user can add movies as favourites which are then available offline too
- Allows the user to change sort order via a setting: The sort order can be by most popular, highest rated or favourties
- Shows additional info when a movie is selected
